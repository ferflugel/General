TIPS:
- We should derive equation 4, provide equation 5, use equation on page 7 to plot the only graph!
- Measure 3 voltages, select 5 settings of resistances for each of the voltages (these are our data points)

APPARATUS NOTES:
- Coil has 130 turns.
- Measurements for the diameter of the coil:
  Outer: 32.3 +- 0.05 cm
  Inner: 29.7 +- 0.05 cm

SCALE:
- Source is 13.6 cm
- Image is 13.0 cm
- Distance between source and glass: 11.7
- Error = 0.05 cm

ERRORS:
Error on voltage = 0.1 V
Error on current = 0.001 A
